Keep browser open: During authentication process
Monitor first trade: Watch logs closely for first signal
Have backup ready: Keep Zerodha app open for manual intervention
Check balance: Verify sufficient funds before starting

🆘 Emergency Diagnostic
If everything fails, run this:
bashecho "=== EMERGENCY DIAGNOSTIC ==="
echo "Time: $(date)"
echo "Connection: $(python cli.py test 2>&1 | head -1)"
echo "Last log: $(tail -1 logs/trading.log 2>/dev/null || echo 'No logs')"
🎉 YOU'RE READY!
Most likely scenario tomorrow:

python cli.py test ← Works fine (tokens still valid)
python cli.py trade ← Start trading immediately

Backup scenario (if tokens expired):

python cli.py test ← Fails
python cli.py auth ← Get new tokens (5 minutes)
python cli.py trade ← Start trading
